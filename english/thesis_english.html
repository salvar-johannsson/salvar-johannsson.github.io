            Trauma is one of the leading causes of mortality, and is the leading cause
            of death among young people. The rapid activation of a trauma team
            for severely injured trauma patients is critical for improving patient outcomes. Severely injured patients must be rapidly identified upon arrival at
            the emergency department to activate a trauma team, making the need for
            triage tools that can rapidly and accurately assess the need for trauma team
            activation (TTA) important. This project explores the use of supervised
            machine learning models to predict the need for TTA using data from the
            Swedish Trauma Registry (SweTrau). The research focuses on the use of two
            machine learning models. A fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for
            analyzing triage notes, and an AdaBoost ensemble model utilizing decision
            trees for structured data selected from the SweTrau by consulting an expert.
            The models were trained to predict the necessity of TTA, defined by a New
            Injury Severity Score (NISS) greater than 15. The results demonstrate that
            both models outperform the current triage practices in terms of sensitivity,
            ability to discern between patients severely injured patients and non-severely
            injured patients, with a combination of the models output offering the best
            performance. Although neither model is yet suitable for clinical use, the
            findings suggest that machine learning has the potential to enhance trauma
            triage protocols, particularly in identifying severe trauma cases that require
            TTA that could otherwise be overlooked.
